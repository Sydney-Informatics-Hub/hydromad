\description{
A unit hydrograph with a quickflow pathway and two layered slowflow pathways
modelling recharge to groundwater in order to allow modelling of long-term
disconnection of slowflow stores from streamflow.
}
\details{
The \code{expuh3s} model consists of a single quickflow pathway modelled as
an exponential store, and a slowflow pathway comprised of two layered
stores.

Each slowflow store is modelled as a \code{\link{leakyExpStore}}, which has
a loss term, has no flow when the store drops below a given level, and can
therefore model longer-term disconnection of a store from streamflow.

Adapted from Herron and Croke (2009):

The upper store, G1, receives rainfall inputs and discharges to the stream,
Qs and recharges the lower store. G1 has a lower limit of 0, where flow
ceases representing the fully 'drained' condition. Conceptually, the upper
store can be viewed as a perched water table, which develops in response to
rain and tends to be relatively short-lived, perhaps seasonal. Thus the time
constant, \code{tau_s}, for discharge from the 'soil' store will be
somewhere between that for quickflow, \code{tau_q} and the groundwater
discharge constant, \code{tau_g}.

G2 is recharged from G1 when \code{G1>G_1} and discharges to the stream
\code{Q_g} when \code{G2>0}. The sum of \code{Q_s} and \code{Q_g} represents
the total slowflow pathway. We assume that all extraction and natural
groundwater losses (\code{loss}) are from G2. The approach avoids the need
to specify a maximum capacity for either storage, but the introduction of a
recharge term, \code{R} between the stores adds a new parameter.

Recharge is represented by a constant rate \code{R} which ceases when
\code{G1<G_1}, diminishing linearly to that point when
\code{thres<G1<thres+loss}. Setting \code{G_1=0} (the default) ceases
recharge when flow ceases.

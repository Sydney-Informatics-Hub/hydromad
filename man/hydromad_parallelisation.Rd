\title{Support for parallelisation in hydromad}
\usage{
hydromad.parallel(settings)
}
\description{
Hydromad allows model runs in some functions to be parallelised. The
parallelisation methods provided for each function depend on its
characteristics and are documented below and in each function's help page.
Parallelisation is by default turned off, as it requires the user to set it
up for their particular computer and to judge whether parallelisation is
worthwhile for their particular case.
}
\details{
A number of functions in hydromad involve performing a large number of model
runs that are to some extent independent of each other. Hydromad uses a
number of R packages to allow these models runs to occur simultaneously.
This usually involves splitting the job between separate 'worker' R
sessions.

However, parallelisation involves an overhead. Even on a single computer, it
takes extra time to communicate with workers to transfer instructions and
retrieve results. Parallelisation is therefore not always worthwhile, and
the best method for parallelising a particular analysis depends on its
characteristics. Do not use parallelisation if you only have a single core,
if you will run out of memory or the analysis already runs quickly.

Several settings of the parallelisation can be modified by specifying a list
of options to the function to be parallelised, with the argument
\code{parallel}, e.g.

\code{evalPars(pars,model,parallel=list(method="foreach",
packages=c("hydromad","fuse"), async=TRUE))}

The available options are described below.

\subsection{method

The available \code{method} are specific to each function that is
parallelised and documented in its respective help page. A summary of the
most common methods is given here.

\code{method="clusterApply"} uses either the built-in \code{parallel}
package or the \code{snow} package. Setting up the cluster requires code
like:

\code{library(parallel)}\cr \code{cl <- makeCluster(2, type="SOCK")}

Functions look for the object 'cl' in the global environment. The function
can be run on multiple cores on non-Windows machines by creating cl using
\code{\link{makeForkCluster}}.

\code{method="foreach"} allows a number of backends, e.g. the packages
\pkg{doParallel}, \pkg{doRedis}. Each of these packages provides a
backend-specific registration function that needs to be called, e.g.

\code{library(doParallel)}\cr \code{registerDoParallel()}

\code{foreach} generally incurs a higher overhead than other methods, but
has the advantage of flexibility. }

\subsection{export If the model being run depends on functions or variables
not defined in the hydromad package, they may need to be explicitly
exported. The names of the variables to be exported are specified as a
character vector, e.g. \code{export=c("mySMA.sim","myNewObjectiveFunction")}

Examples: \itemize{ \item if you have created your own soil moisture
accounting function \code{mySMA.sim} \item if your objective function or a
model you have made yourself depends on other functions or variables in the
global environment, e.g.
\code{objective=function(Q,X){myNewObjectiveFunction(Q-X)+hmadstat("r.squared")(Q,X)}}
} }

\subsection{packages If you are using models that defined in another
package, e.g. the \code{fuse} set of models, then the workers can be told to
load the package as well as hydromad by specifying, e.g.
\code{packages=c("hydromad","fuse")}. Make sure the package is installed on
all the workers. }

\subsection{async If the parallelisation method supports it, some functions
allow runs to occur in the background. Instead the function returns
immediately. Results can be retrieved later using methods specific to the
parallelisation method. Where available, this feature is enabled with
\code{async=TRUE} }

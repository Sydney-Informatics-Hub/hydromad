\usage{
event.xyplot(x, ...)

\method{event.xyplot}{formula}(
  x,
  data = list(),
  events,
  ...,
  response = NULL,
  eFUN = sum,
  as.table = TRUE,
  layout = NULL,
  auto.key = NCOL(response) > 1,
  xlab = "event-aggregated covariate values",
  ylab = "event-aggregated response"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object for the generic method; in the \code{formula} method this
is a \code{\link{formula}} as described in the Details section.  All terms
in the formula should be aggregated in the given \code{events}; for this
purpose a special function \code{e()} is defined as a shorthand for
\code{\link{eventapply}}, with arguments \code{e(X, FUN = sum, ...)}.  The
formula may specify a response (the left hand side of formula), which is
treated as a single term, although it can be a matrix with multiple columns.
Alternatively, the response matrix can be given in \code{response}.  The
covariate terms are also allowed to be matrix-like with the same number of
columns as the response, in which case each column is plotted against the
corresponsing column of the response.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments passed to \code{\link{xyplot}} (actually
\code{\link{xyplot.list}}).}

\item{data}{data source giving variables used in the formula. Typically a
\code{data.frame}. Passed to \code{\link{model.frame}}.}

\item{events}{event sequence produced by \code{\link{eventseq}}, or a vector
defining continguous groups on the specified variables.}

\item{response}{a response vector or matrix corresponding to the variables
in the formula. If this is given, any response in the formula is ignored.}

\item{eFUN}{a function to aggregate \code{response}, if it is given, in the
given \code{events}. If a reponse appears in the formula it should be in a
\code{e()} term, and \code{eFUN} is not used.}

\item{as.table, layout, auto.key, xlab, ylab}{passed to \code{\link{xyplot}}.}
}
\value{
this function returns a trellis object which can be \code{plot}ted.

\examples{

data(Canning)
ev <- eventseq(Canning$P, thresh = 20, inthresh = 1, indur = 3,
               continue = FALSE)
event.xyplot(e(Q,sum) / e(P,sum) ~ e(P,sum) + e(P,max) + e(lag(Q,-1),first),

             xlab = c("total rain (mm)", "max rain (mm/day)",
             "antecedent flow (mm/day)"))

## multiple response variables
event.xyplot(cbind(e(Q,quantile,0.9),e(Q,quantile,0.99)) ~
             e(P,max) + e(P,mean) + e(P,sum),
             data = Canning, events = ev,
             scales = list(y = list(log = TRUE)),
             yscale.components = yscale.components.log10.3)

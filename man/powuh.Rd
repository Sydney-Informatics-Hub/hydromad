\description{
A power-law form of unit hydrograph (transfer function).
}
\details{
The power law form of the unit hydrograph is:

\deqn{H = 1 / (1 + (t/a)^{b/c}) ^ c}

where H is the fraction of peak flow, t is the time since peak, and a, b and
c are parameters.

From Croke (2006):

Parameter a is the value of t (time since peak) at which the ordinate of the
asymptote \eqn{(t/a)^(-b)} has a value of 1, b determines the persistence of
the flow response and c defines the shape of the response curve near its
peak. The c parameter appears twice in order to reduce interaction between
the b and c parameters (in this form, the c parameter only influences the
curvature near t = a, and doesn't influence the asymptote, which is
determined solely by the b parameter). The time for H to decrease to 0.5 is
\eqn{a(2^(1/c) - 1)^(c/b)}. While this is a three parameter model, for
\eqn{t >> a} only the b parameter is significant. Since the value of the a
parameter is typically significantly less than one (see Table 1) the
recession curve can be written as

\deqn{H = (t_r / t)^b}

where \eqn{t_r} is some reference time (\eqn{t_r >> a}) at which the
hydrograph profile has been normalized. Thus the remaining two parameters (a
and c) only influence the response curve near the event peak, and [the
equation above] can be taken as a single parameter recession model.

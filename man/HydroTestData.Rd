\title{A simple simulated dataset for use in testing hydrological models.}
\format{
A \code{\link{zooreg}} object with 730 (365 * 2) time steps.

There are three columns, \code{P} (simulated areal rainfall, mm/day),
\code{E} (simulated temperature, degrees Celcius) and \code{Q} (simulated
streamflow, mm/day).

\description{
A simple simulated dataset for use in testing hydrological models.
}
\details{
\describe{ \item{Rainfall (P)}{ a regular series of impulses (every 20 time
steps). Each of these pulses have a value of 5, except one which has a value
of 20.  } \item{Temperature (E)}{ a sine wave ranging from 0 to 30.  }
\item{Streamflow (Q)}{ proportional to the square of rainfall and inversely
to temperature, then filtered with a second-order autoregressive
\code{\link{filter}}.  } }

\title{Exponential store with zero flows and thresholded loss}
\usage{
leakyExpStore.sim(x, tau, loss, thres, init = 0, return_components = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{input time series.}

\item{tau}{Time constant for flow from exponential store.}

\item{loss}{Constant loss that occurs while the value of the store is
greater than \code{thres}. See details.}

\item{thres}{Trigger level to turn off loss, which can be interpreted as a
store capacity.}

\item{init}{Initial value of exponential store}

\item{return_components}{whether to return store value (G) as well as flow
(Q)}
}
\value{
the flow time series with the same dimensions and time windows as
the input \code{x}.  If \code{return_components = TRUE}, it will have
multiple columns named \code{G} and \code{Q}.
}
\description{
An exponential store (linear transfer function) which has a loss term,
produces no flow when the store drops below a level, and can therefore model
longer-term disconnection of a store from streamflow.
}
\details{
Storage is increased by effective rainfall and decreased by flow and losses.
\deqn{G[k] = G[k-1] + U[k] - Q[k] - L[k]}

Flow is proportional to storage \deqn{Q[k] = a G[k], G[k]>0} \deqn{Q[k] = 0,
otherwise}

Loss switches off at some threshold, as a piece-wise continuous function.
\deqn{L[k] = L, G[k]>T+L (with T<=0)} \deqn{L[k] = G[k] - T, T+L > G[k] > T}
\deqn{L[k] = 0, G[k]<T}
}

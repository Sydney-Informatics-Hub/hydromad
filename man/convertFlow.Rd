\usage{
convertFlow(
  x,
  from = "mm",
  to = "mm",
  area.km2 = -1,
  timestep.default = "days"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector or time series.}

\item{from}{units to convert from (see Details).}

\item{to}{units to convert into (see Details).}

\item{area.km2}{area (in square kilometres) that flow volume is averaged
over.  This must be given when converting between measures of depth and
measures of volume.}

\item{timestep.default}{the time step if not specified in \code{from} or
\code{to}.}

\description{
This function converts between units of flow (volumetric throughput),
designed mainly for hydrology applications. As a special case, this function
can also convert units of volume or units of depth (length).
}
\details{
This function can convert flow rates between different volume units, or
different timestep units, or both. Volume can be specified directly, or as a
depth and area combination.

The unit specifications \code{from} and \code{to} can include a time step,
like \code{"volume / timestep"}. A multiplier may also be included with the
time step, like \code{"volume / N timesteps"}.  If no time step is specified
in \code{from} and \code{to}, then it is taken to be
\code{timestep.default}.

The volume units supported are: (these can be abbreviated)

\code{mL, cL, dL, L, daL, hL, kL, ML, GL, TL}

\code{cm^3, dm^3, m^3, km^3, ft^3}

The depth units supported are: (these can be abbreviated)

\code{mm, cm, metres, km, inches, feet}

The time units supported are: (these can be abbreviated)

\code{ms, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years / annum}

Additionally, the value \code{"cumecs"} (cubic metres per second) is
equivalent to \code{"m^3/sec"}.
}
\section{Warning}{
 The time step \code{"year"} refers to the average length
of a year, i.e. 365.25 days (one \emph{annum}). Similarly, the time step
\code{"month"} refers to the average length of a month, i.e. 365.25 / 12 =
30.4375 days.
}

\examples{

flowML <- c(0, 1, 100, 10)
## from megalitres per day to gigalitres per year
convertFlow(flowML, from="ML / day", to="GL / yr")
## from ML/step to mm/step averaged over 50 km^2
convertFlow(flowML, from="ML", to="mm", area=50)
## from ML/day to cubic metres per second
(flowCM <- convertFlow(flowML, from="ML/day", to="m^3/sec"))
## from cubic metres per second to mm/minute averaged over 0.1 km^2
convertFlow(flowCM, from="cumecs", to="mm/15min", area=0.1)
## 100 mm in inches
convertFlow(100, to="in")

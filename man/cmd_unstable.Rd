\title{Unstable/unoptimised version of IHACRES Catchment Moisture Deficit (CMD)
model}
\usage{
cmd_unstable.sim(DATA, g, e, d, shape = 0, M_0 = d/2, return_state = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{DATA}{a \code{\link{ts}}-like object with named columns: \describe{
\item{list("P")}{ time series of areal rainfall depths, usually in mm. }
\item{list("E")}{ time series of potential evapo-transpiration, or more
typically, temperature as an indicator of this. } }}

\item{g}{CMD stress threshold}

\item{e}{temperature to PET conversion factor.}

\item{d}{CMD threshold for producing flow.}

\item{shape}{defines form of the \eqn{dU/dP} relationship: \code{shape = 0}
is the linear form, \code{shape = 1} is the trigonometric form, and
\code{shape > 1} is the power form.}

\item{M_0}{starting CMD value.}

\item{return_state}{to return state variables as well as the effective
rainfall.}
}
\value{
\code{cmd_unstable.sim} returns the modelled time series of
effective rainfall, or if \code{return_state = TRUE}, a multi-variate time
series with named columns \code{U} (effective rainfall), \code{CMD} and
\code{ET} (evapo-transpiration \eqn{E_T}).
}
\description{
Unoptimised version of CMD model. \code{g} is directly specified, and
therefore highly correlated with \code{d}.  Other anything than for
demonstration purposes, \code{\link{cmd}} should be used instead.
}
\details{
See \code{\link{cmd.sim}} for details.

This version is modified so that \code{g} is specified directly instead of
being calculated as \code{g=f*d}
}
\note{
Normally compiled C code is used for simulation, but if
\code{return_state = TRUE} a slower implementation in R is used.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{cmd.sim}} for preferred version.

# Contributing to hydromad

This document outlines how to contribute changes to hydromad.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before attemping to make a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct that we request you adhere to in all your interactions with this project (see below).

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  YES: you edit a roxygen2 comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If you’ve found a
bug, create an associated issue using our `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.
The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.  
*  We recommend the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.  
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) for documentation.  
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit testing. Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.  
*  Please refer to `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for a full checklist that needs to be completed before making your PR. 
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
current development version header describing the changes made followed by your
GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).

#' Exponential components transfer function models with layered slowflow stores
#' 
#' A unit hydrograph with a quickflow pathway and two layered slowflow pathways
#' modelling recharge to groundwater in order to allow modelling of long-term
#' disconnection of slowflow stores from streamflow.
#' 
#' 
#' The \code{expuh3s} model consists of a single quickflow pathway modelled as
#' an exponential store, and a slowflow pathway comprised of two layered
#' stores.
#' 
#' Each slowflow store is modelled as a \code{\link{leakyExpStore}}, which has
#' a loss term, has no flow when the store drops below a given level, and can
#' therefore model longer-term disconnection of a store from streamflow.
#' 
#' Adapted from Herron and Croke (2009):
#' 
#' The upper store, G1, receives rainfall inputs and discharges to the stream,
#' Qs and recharges the lower store. G1 has a lower limit of 0, where flow
#' ceases representing the fully 'drained' condition. Conceptually, the upper
#' store can be viewed as a perched water table, which develops in response to
#' rain and tends to be relatively short-lived, perhaps seasonal. Thus the time
#' constant, \code{tau_s}, for discharge from the 'soil' store will be
#' somewhere between that for quickflow, \code{tau_q} and the groundwater
#' discharge constant, \code{tau_g}.
#' 
#' G2 is recharged from G1 when \code{G1>G_1} and discharges to the stream
#' \code{Q_g} when \code{G2>0}. The sum of \code{Q_s} and \code{Q_g} represents
#' the total slowflow pathway. We assume that all extraction and natural
#' groundwater losses (\code{loss}) are from G2. The approach avoids the need
#' to specify a maximum capacity for either storage, but the introduction of a
#' recharge term, \code{R} between the stores adds a new parameter.
#' 
#' Recharge is represented by a constant rate \code{R} which ceases when
#' \code{G1<G_1}, diminishing linearly to that point when
#' \code{thres<G1<thres+loss}. Setting \code{G_1=0} (the default) ceases
#' recharge when flow ceases.

#' @param epsilon values smaller than this in the output will be set to zero.
#' @return the model output as a \code{\link{ts}} object, with the same
